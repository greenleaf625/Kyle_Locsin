97 Things every programmer should know

Chapter 1 Act with Prudence

Before- 
As I was in my first year college, it's hobby of me to just let things go, like I will do this task tommorow, and same thing on the next day and so on, that every little I skip, adds up and it take more time to do it than making it before, also I don't write my task or a "To do list" because of my lazyness or procrastinate things that are not valuable, like playing, or scrolling in my facebook newsfeed, even though I know that my doing is wrong, I still do it because of me being "I can still make it, the deadline is too long, I can still make it in 3-2 days before the deadline" and when the day comes, I start cramming because of too many stack work loads that I didn't even do.

After- 
Sometime later, I do realize that I can't live in always in that situation, also this chapter helps me to realize, how crucial this thing can be in my way of working, I should start to list all my priorities more, make the task as soon as possible so I can also have time to check it if it has bugs or errors, also I can ask my colleague to critized my work so I can make it better and also help me improve of skills.
